# The Hungry Snake

### Introduction
The objective of the game is to direct the snake to consume the food and try to make it grow as long as possible to maximise the score. The program is coded on java and Jframe extension is also used. 
> The aim of this project was to use the Oops principles and write a very efficient code for the above problem statement. 

### Installation
- unzip the entire project directory and open the file system in your prefered text editor
- since we are using JFrame, it should be imported along with java.
- in the GameBoard class make sure you reset the file path appropriately in following lines of code. <br>
``
ImageIcon iid = new ImageIcon("code_files/src/game/dot.png"); `` <br>  ``
ImageIcon iia = new ImageIcon("code_files/src/game/apple.png"); `` <br> ``
ImageIcon iih = new ImageIcon("code_files/src/game/head.png"); ``<br>
